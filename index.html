                <h2>I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at Georgia State University. 
                    I have a passion for building innovative solutions and tackling complex problems through coding and technology. 
                    When Iâ€™m not immersed in programming, I enjoy playing pickleball and crocheting. I love staying active, learning new skills, 
                    and exploring creative hobbies in my free time. Feel free to explore my work and get a glimpse into my journey as a CS student!</h2>

                <h2>MealMate</h2>
                <p>I worked together with a teammate to complete this Android app. It is an app that allows users to look up recipes according to specific allergies. 
                    Users can also favorite a recipe, which gets saved in the 'Favorites' tab. Additionally, users can add recipes to their daily meal planner. 
                    From these recipes, users have the option to add ingredients directly to their grocery list.</p>

                <h2>SuitYourself</h2>
                <p>SuitYourself was developed as part of an all-female hackathon with the theme of benefiting women. The app uses cutting-edge AI to help women build and manage a wardrobe that adapts to their unique needs and preferences.

                    Leveraging a combination of powerful APIs, including Google Calendar, Google Cloud Vision, a Menstrual Cycle API, and a Weather API, SuitYourself intelligently suggests outfits based on the userâ€™s calendar events, the weather forecast, and even their menstrual cycle, ensuring that the user is always dressed appropriately and comfortably.
                    
                    Key features include:
                    
                        AI-powered outfit recommendations based on the userâ€™s wardrobe and real-time data from external APIs.
                        Integration with Google Calendar to sync scheduled events and automatically recommend outfits tailored for those events.
                        Weather-driven suggestions that adapt to daily conditions, ensuring the perfect outfit for any climate.
                        Menstrual Cycle integration to consider body changes and suggest clothing that accommodates different phases of the cycle.
                        A Chatbot powered by OpenAI that allows users to interact with the app, asking questions about their wardrobe, outfit suggestions, and style tips.
                    
                    This app aims to help women optimize their wardrobes, save time, and feel confident in their outfit choices, no matter the occasion..</p>
